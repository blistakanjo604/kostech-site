        <h2>Linux Server Administration</h2>
        <p>Are you looking to distance yourself from privacy invasive services like Google and Microsoft? Our custom <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank">NextCloud</a>  and <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank">Seafile</a> deployments mean you don’t pay for convenience with privacy.</p>

        <h2>IP Video Surveillance</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Resolution</b> Don’t settle for grainy analog security footage. Our 1080P IP video cameras mean you get the detail you need with the flexibility to view it on your computer, on your phone, or on your video monitoring system!</li>
          <li><b>Scalability</b> With previous camera systems you had to decide up front how many cameras you wanted and purchase a DVR based on your camera count. With an IP video system you can get started with a single camera, and grow to 50, on
            your schedule and on your budget!</li>
          <li><b>Analytics</b> A network video system means you can save events, find specific moments, all from an app or a browser. Stop scrubbing through hours of footage. Our IP camera systems highlight events for your review based on specific
            parameters you provide such as motion, tampering and a wide range of other events.</li>

        <h2>Guest Hotspot Solutions and Home Services</h2>
        <p>In today’s world, WiFi is like hot water. Customers, clients, guests, and patients expect to stay connected. Don’t settle for consumer-grade routers and access points that don’t meet industry standards and leave your business exposed to
          malicious threats. As internet connection issues are also a problem in our homes KOS Tech IT Services looks to expand our support to the home user, providing better routers, custom home solutions, and software installation to ensure you
          have the smoothest experience in your everyday lives</p>
